===========

###This is a USC CSCI580 HW Repo

HW1: Construct the framebuffer for display; check the boundaries and intensities while reading the data; write the rect data to ppm file and framebuffer. 

HW2: Implement scan line algorithm to produce a working scan converter.

HW3: Add the transformation process to the rendering library.

HW4: Add a flexible shader to the rendering library. The renderer should continue to support flat-shading. In addition, it now supports Phong shading of vertices with linear (screen space) color interpolation over the triangle. AND, it should support full Phong shading at each pixel with bilinear (screen space) normal interpolation over the triangle.

HW5: Add texturing capabilities to the rendering library.

HW6: Create an application that performs multipass antialiasing. The algorithm computes multiple samples distributed around each display pixel and weights (filters) these into one final value. A screen space offset is added to the transformed vertex coordinates of each triangle to produce the sample distribution.
