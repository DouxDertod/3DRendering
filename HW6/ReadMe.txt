Some Instructions:
1. I modified the content based on HW5 code: Application.h, Application5.h, gz.h, rend.h, Application5.cpp, CS580HWView.cpp, and rend.cpp are 
   all changed to finish this anti-aliasing assignment.
2. There is One additional function to help finish the process of anti-aliasing, It is:

void shiftPos(GzRender *render, vector<Vertex>& vertPos); //add the offsets to the vert position
